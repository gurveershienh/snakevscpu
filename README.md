# Snake vs CPU üêç
![Gameplay Demo](assets/snakevscpu_demo.gif)

It‚Äôs Snake. But not just *any* snake. This is **Player vs. CPU Snake**, built with `pygame-ce`, where squishy human (blue) reflexes go head-to-head with a cold, calculating AI serpent (green) who does not know mercy.

The CPU snake is powered by a greedy algorithm. It moves fast, grows quickly, and can be outsmarted

## Greedy Snake AI

The CPU snake uses a **greedy pathfinding algorithm**. On each update cycle, it evaluates available directions and chooses the one that brings it closest to the fruit while avoiding collisions with:
- The board edges
- Its own body
- The player snake

It uses **squared Euclidean distance** for fast calculation and purely local heuristics‚Äîno full pathfinding, no memory. It‚Äôs hungry and reckless.
